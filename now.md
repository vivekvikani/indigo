# /Now
This is a new page on my site, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now), who came up with the idea of a “Now Page”. It gives you a glimpse into my life beyond 9to5, and it holds me accountable for making it count. :)

## What I'm up to right **NOW**:

* Learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
* Reading [The Black Swan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan) by Nassim Taleb.
